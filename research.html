                            Plastic waste, or plastic pollution, is ‘the accumulation of plastic objects (e.g.: plastic
                            bottles and much more) in the Earth’s environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife
                            habitat, and humans.’

                            It also refers to the significant amount of plastic that isn’t recycled and ends up in
                            landfill
                            or, in the developing world, thrown into unregulated dump sites. In the UK, for example,
                            over 5
                            million tonnes of plastic is consumed each year — and yet only 1 quarter of it is recycled.

                            The three quarters that isn’t recycled enters our environment, polluting our oceans and
                            causing
                            damage to our ecosystem. In less developed countries, the majority of plastic waste
                            eventually
                            ends up in the ocean, meaning that marine animals are especially at risk.

                            So much of what we consume is made of plastic (such as plastic bottles and food containers)
                            because it’s inexpensive, yet durable. However, plastic is slow to degrade (taking over 400
                            years or more) due to its chemical structure, which presents a huge challenge.

                            Reducing plastic consumption and raising awareness about plastic recycling is crucial if we
                            are
                            to overcome the problem of plastic waste and pollution on our planet.

                            Since the late 20th century, we have depended on plastic as an affordable, versatile and
                            durable material.

                            However, since the majority of plastic materials take centuries to degrade, all of the
                            plastic that has been sent to landfills in the UK still exists — and yet we’re still
                            producing and consuming more of it.

                            That plastic has to go somewhere, and it’s frequently either dumped carelessly on land or in
                            rivers in developing countries, before ending up in the ocean, where it threatens marine
                            life.

                            The fact is, we simply can’t cope with the amount of plastic on our planet — nor the amount
                            that continues to be produced. For this reason, our attitudes and behaviours towards plastic
                            must change to ensure a safe and healthy future for our planet.

                            the first place?

                            In many cases, specifically in more developed countries, plastic waste is disposed of
                            responsibly and sent to facilities to be sorted, recycled or recovered.

                            However, plastic waste generated in developing countries typically ends up in open
                            unregulated dump sites, or is thrown into rivers and streams. Plastics from dump sites can
                            be blown by winds into bodies of water, such as nearby rivers, before being carried out to
                            sea.

                            According to the United Nations, ‘at least 800 species worldwide are affected by marine
                            debris, and as much as 80 percent of that litter is plastic.’

                            Marine animals can either get caught in plastic objects (such as the plastic rings that hold
                            drinks cans together), ingest the plastic, and/or be exposed to plastic chemicals, which can
                            alter their physiology over time.

                            A recent study found that ‘sea turtles that ingest just 14 pieces of plastic have an
                            increased risk of death.’ In particular, young turtles are at a higher risk because they
                            tend to drift with the same currents that attract plastic waste, and they are less selective
                            than their elders about what they eat.

                            The problem with plastic microbeads
                            Plastic microbeads, which are commonly found in toiletries such as facial scrubs,
                            toothpastes, and shower gels can also wreak havoc on marine life. Most sewage treatment
                            facilities cannot capture these beads from incoming sewage and so they are discharged
                            directly into water courses. The BBC explains that ‘They do not degrade over time and can
                            transport toxic chemicals into marine organisms.’

                            Six decades ago, mass production of plastics began — accelerating so rapidly that it has
                            created 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic — and over 90% of it isn’t recycled.

                            As of 2018, approximately 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year. Our
                            planet can’t cope with this amount of plastic polluting the environment, and calls to reduce
                            plastic pollution and consumption have increased in urgency in recent years.

                            1. Plastic is cheap, readily available, and its use is widespread
                            Since plastic is an affordable and durable material, it can be found in everything from
                            packaging materials to plastic bottles, straws to plastic bags, and much more.

                            Until businesses start to utilise more environmentally-friendly, alternative materials (such
                            as paper), the cycle of producing and disposing of plastic will continue.



                            2. The world’s population is growing — and so is urbanisation
                            Put simply, the more of us there are in the world, the greater the demand for cheap
                            materials and in turn, the more plastic we use to excess.

                            To illustrate this, in the first decade of this century, more plastic has been produced than
                            ever due to rapid urbanisation and, in turn, demand.



                            3. We have a disposable mentality when it comes to plastic
                            Plastic items typically have a very short lifespan — think carrier bags, water bottles,
                            straws, and food containers. And because they’re so cheap to make, we don’t value them
                            enough to hang on to individual items.

                            Not only that, but the disposal of plastic is often mismanaged — so again, it ends up in
                            landfills.



                            4. Plastic takes over 400 years to decompose
                            The chemical bonds that make-up plastic are strong and made to last. The decomposition rate
                            of plastic can vary depending on the type, however, this typically ranges from 50 to 600
                            years.

                            In other words, according to the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency in the United
                            States), almost every bit of plastic ever made and sent to landfill or dumped in the
                            environment still exists — a sobering thought for us all.

                            As new plastic items are manufactured every day, the cycle repeats.



                            5. Marine shipping and fishing industries
                            The shipping and fishing industries are also responsible for contributing towards plastic
                            waste and pollution, particularly in our oceans.

                            Plastic waste is often washed to shores from ships and nets used for fishing, which — you
                            guessed it — are usually made from plastic.

                            Not only does this plastic pollute the water, but marine animals can become trapped in nets
                            and/or swallow the toxic particles.

                            Overall, the shipping and fishing industries have a lot to answer for when it comes to
                            plastic pollution.

                            Bioplastics:
                            Bioplastics — sounds good, right?

                            Especially when most plastics come from fossil fuels. Bioplastics, on the other hand, may
                            come from plant-based sources, such as flaxseeds — and companies are often eager to use this
                            as a selling point.

                            However, as the 2015 United Nations report states, once the polymer is created, the material
                            properties are the same. In other words, the resulting material is no better than any other
                            form of plastic.

                            Bioplastic or not, it’s still wise to cut down on our plastic consumption wherever possible.
                            Bioplastics also can’t be recycled — nor can they be composted.
                            <hr>
                            Compostable plastics:
                            Compostable plastic is very similar to biodegradable plastic, except to achieve
                            ‘compostable’ status, it must be monitored and verified by an independent third party
                            organisation.

                            However, being virtually the same as biodegradable plastic, compostable plastic still poses
                            the same challenges when it ends up in our oceans. Nearly all UK organic waste treatment
                            facilities can’t treat this material and will take it out as a residue sent for incineration
                            or landfill.

                            The above three types of plastic all emphasise that the best way to reduce plastic waste and
                            pollution is to simply cut down. More specifically, we should be focusing on eliminating the
                            use of single use, unrecyclable, and not recycled plastic (think takeaway cups, polystyrene
                            food trays like ‘clam shell’ boxes and carrier bags).

                            Biodegradable plastics:
                            Biodegradable plastics (plastics that can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, and
                            minerals through natural processes) are another seemingly appealing alternative.

                            To use the term ‘biodegradable’, products must conform to national or international
                            standards. In Europe, for example, for a plastic product to be deemed biodegradable it must:

                            Not contain high levels of heavy metals
                            90% of the plastic must break down into CO2 within six months of being exposed to natural
                            processes (including sunlight and hydrolysis)
                            12 weeks after exposure, 90% of the plastic leftover must be able to pass through a mesh
                            measuring 2 x 2 mm
                            The final material must not prove toxic to plants
                            Despite this, the speed of degradation depends heavily on the type of plastic and the
                            environment it’s in. It often does not degrade properly, as highlighted in this article.

                            Treatment plants for organic waste, such as in-vessel composters or anaerobic digestion
                            facilities cannot treat these plastics, since they either disrupt the treatment process or
                            simply take too long to biodegrade. These plastics also need a certain constant temperature
                            range for a prolonged period in time in order to breakdown. In reality, the ocean’s
                            temperature is vastly different, which will affect the rate at which the plastic
                            biodegrades.

                            Bioplastics don’t solve the problem of plastic in the ocean, or prevent harmful
                            microplastics from being produced.

                            Once in the ocean, UV radiation and wave action helps to break down plastic. However, once
                            the plastic is submerged in deep water, where it can become covered in biofilm or buried in
                            sediment (only 4%-5% of ocean plastics are found on beaches and shorelines), the speed at
                            which the plastic can break down falls significantly.

                            The term ‘biodegradable plastic’ is clearly misleading, and certainly not a quick solution
                            to tackling plastic pollution.

                            The benefits of reducing plastic consumption include:

                            Preventing pollution by lessening the amount of new raw materials used
                            Saves energy

                            Saves money, since reusable items work out cheaper than constantly purchasing more plastic

                            To reduce your business’ or personal output of plastic waste, try switching from plastic
                            materials to paper or glass wherever you can, as these materials are widely recycled.

                            Reducing (or ideally cutting out altogether) your consumption of plastic water bottles,
                            plastic bags, and straws can also make a huge difference.

                            Your commercial waste collector may claim that they recycle a large percentage of your
                            waste, but this can be extremely difficult to trace. In fact, the compliance reporting of
                            London sorting facilities and private commercial waste collectors paints a very different
                            picture.

                            This information is freely accessible on the WRAP recycling portal — just register your
                            details to download performance reports for numerous recycling sorting facilities and
                            collectors.

                            Most specifically, the reports show that much of the recycling collected from businesses is
                            heavily contaminated. Therefore, it’s likely that many of your mixed recycling items don’t
                            get recycled at all.

                            Pay special attention to the reporting categories ‘Average non-target % of composition’ and
                            ‘Average non-recyclable % of composition’; the higher the percentage, the worse the
                            collector performs. This demonstrates the amount collected that was simply thrown out as
                            general waste for disposal because of its poor quality.

                            Businesses and individuals can make a concerted effort to reduce the amount of plastic they
                            purchase, use, and discard. Small habitual changes, such as those listed above, can make a
                            positive difference by reducing the amount of plastic pollution.

                            However, on a larger scale, recycling sorting facilities must also adhere to strict
                            guidelines. There should also be greater visibility over where every single bit of plastic
                            goes after being put into mixed recycling.

                            Responsibility, traceability, and transparency are key to ensuring waste is respected and
                            can be utilised as a potential future resource wherever possible.

                            In 2017, scientists were shocked to discover that 6.3 billion tons out of 6.9 billion tons
                            of plastic never made it to a recycling bin. And that’s not the only figure that we should
                            be concerned by:

                            1. Over two million tonnes of plastic waste has been dumped in our oceans globally this year
                            so far
                            <hr>
                            2. In the North Pacific ocean, there are six times more items of plastic debris than
                            plankton
                            <hr>
                            3. Since the 1950s, 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced worldwide
                            <hr>
                            4. Of that 8.3 billion tonnes, only 9% has been recycled
                            <hr>
                            5. In 2017, Kenya banned the use and sale of plastic bags altogether — and many other
                            countries are now following suit
                            <hr>
                            6. However, worldwide, 2 million plastic bags are still being used every minute

                            Raising awareness is crucial if we are to overcome the challenges of plastic waste and
                            pollution.

                            Documentaries and TV series’ such as the BBC’s Blue Planet II, presented by David
                            Attenborough, have helped to bring the issue of plastic waste to the forefront. However,
                            there’s still much to overcome to change attitudes and behaviours towards plastic,
                            especially in our ‘disposable’ culture.

                            At Westminster City Council Commercial Waste Services, our festive initiative, partnered
                            with Veolia and the Heart of London Business Alliance, to raise awareness through creative
                            recycling is one of the many ways we’re raising the importance of recycling in London.

                            To help, you can start by introducing more sustainable practices and attitudes towards
                            plastic in your business.

                            Plastic waste has become a pressing global concern, posing significant challenges to the
                            environment, public health, and sustainable development. The management of plastic waste
                            aligns with several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reflecting
                            the interconnected nature of these global challenges.

                            Plastic Waste and the SDGs:

                            Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production:

                            The production and consumption of plastics contribute to environmental degradation. Goal 12
                            emphasizes the need for sustainable consumption and production patterns, urging industries
                            and consumers to minimize their environmental impact, including the production and disposal
                            of plastic products.
                            Goal 14: Life Below Water:

                            Plastic waste poses a severe threat to marine life and ecosystems. Goal 14 calls for the
                            conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources, highlighting the
                            importance of addressing plastic pollution to protect marine biodiversity.
                            Goal 15: Life on Land:

                            Plastic pollution extends beyond marine environments, affecting terrestrial ecosystems as
                            well. Goal 15 advocates for the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial
                            ecosystems, emphasizing the need to manage plastic waste to prevent land degradation.
                            Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation:

                            Improper disposal of plastic waste can contaminate water sources, jeopardizing clean water
                            availability. Goal 6 focuses on ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all,
                            underscoring the importance of managing plastic waste to safeguard water quality.
                            Goal 13: Climate Action:

                            The life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal, contributes to greenhouse gas
                            emissions. Goal 13 urges action to combat climate change, emphasizing the need to reduce the
                            environmental impact of plastic production and disposal.
                            Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:

                            Urban areas are significant contributors to plastic waste. Goal 11 calls for sustainable
                            cities and communities, promoting responsible waste management practices, including the
                            reduction, reuse, and recycling of plastics.
                            Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:

                            Innovations in plastic alternatives and recycling technologies contribute to Goal 9, which
                            encourages sustainable industrialization and infrastructure development. Finding
                            alternatives to single-use plastics and improving recycling processes are essential
                            components of achieving this goal.
                            Conclusion:

                            Addressing the challenge of plastic waste management is integral to achieving multiple
                            Sustainable Development Goals. A holistic approach that incorporates responsible
                            consumption, innovative solutions, and international collaboration is essential to mitigate
                            the environmental impact of plastic waste and foster a more sustainable future. Individuals,
                            industries, and governments must work together to minimize the generation of plastic waste,
                            improve recycling infrastructure, and promote the transition to a circular economy that
                            values the responsible use of resources.
